- PostgreSQL database (or Supabase account)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>
   cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Set up environment variables:
   - Copy `.env.example` in `payload-admin/` to `.env` and fill in your configuration (database, secrets, etc.)

   npm run dev
   ```
   - For the admin backend, run:
   ```sh
   cd payload-admin

   ```

### Project Structure

- `src/` — Frontend React app (pages, components, hooks, integrations)
- `payload-admin/` — Backend admin panel (Payload CMS, collections, server)
- `public/` — Static assets
- `supabase/` — Database migrations and config
- `*.config.*` — Project configuration (Vite, Tailwind, TypeScript, etc.)

### Scripts

- `npm run dev` — Start frontend in development mode
- `npm run build` — Build frontend for production
- `npm start` — Start production server (admin)
- `npm run build` (in `payload-admin/`) — Build admin backend

## Deployment

You can deploy the platform using Docker, PM2, or your preferred Node.js hosting. Example Dockerfile and PM2 config are provided in `payload-admin/`.

1. Build the frontend and backend:
   ```sh
   npm run build
   cd payload-admin
   npm run build
   ```
2. Set environment variables for production in `.env`.
3. Start the servers using your preferred process manager or Docker.

## Customization

- Add new features by creating React components in `src/components/` or new collections in `payload-admin/src/collections/`.
- Update styles using Tailwind CSS and custom CSS files.
- Configure admin panel appearance in `payload-admin/src/styles/admin.css`.

## API
